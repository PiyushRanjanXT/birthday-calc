# birthday-calc

Birthday Cal is a week long calendar!  Render a card for each day of the week. For a given year, figure out whose birthday belongs to which card. Place people's initials in the card according to these rules -



* Each person must always be rendered as square
* Use person's initials to label birthdays
* Order people inside the card based on their age (youngest to oldest)
* Each square in a card must be of equal size and should fill up as much space in the card as possible
